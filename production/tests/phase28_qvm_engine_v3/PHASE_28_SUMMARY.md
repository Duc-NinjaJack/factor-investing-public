- No adaptation to changing market conditions
- Excessive regime switching

**Robust Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Percentile-Based Dynamic Thresholds
vol_75th = rolling_vol.rolling(252).quantile(0.75)
return_75th = rolling_return.rolling(252).quantile(0.75)

# 2. Ensemble Multi-Criteria Approach
indicators = {
    'volatility': 0.25,
    'drawdown': 0.25,
    'momentum': 0.25,
    'correlation': 0.25
}

# 3. Regime Stability Filter
min_regime_duration = 20  # Prevent excessive switching
```
