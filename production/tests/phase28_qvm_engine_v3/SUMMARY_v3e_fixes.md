# QVM Engine v3e - Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

The original QVM Engine v3e had a critical issue where only one regime was detected throughout the entire backtest period. This was caused by using hard-coded thresholds that were not adaptive to different market conditions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Percentile-based Regime Detection

**Before (Problematic)**:
```yaml
regime:
  volatility_threshold: 0.2659  # Fixed threshold
  return_threshold: 0.2588      # Fixed threshold  
  low_return_threshold: 0.2131  # Fixed threshold
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```yaml
regime:
  lookback_period: 90
  volatility_percentile_high: 75.0  # 75th percentile for high volatility
  return_percentile_high: 75.0      # 75th percentile for high return
  return_percentile_low: 25.0       # 25th percentile for low return
```

### 2. Key Improvements

- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Regime thresholds now adapt to market conditions using rolling percentiles
- **Robust Classification**: Proper regime classification logic implemented
- **Multiple Regimes**: Successfully detects momentum, stress, and normal regimes
- **Adaptive Allocations**: Portfolio allocations change based on detected regimes

### 3. Regime Detection Logic

The new `RegimeDetector` class:
- Maintains historical volatility and return data
- Calculates rolling percentiles over a lookback period
- Classifies regimes based on percentile thresholds:
  - **Momentum**: High volatility (>75th percentile) + High return (>75th percentile)
  - **Stress**: High volatility (>75th percentile) + Low return (<25th percentile)
  - **Normal**: Low volatility + Normal return

### 4. Portfolio Allocation

Each regime now has appropriate allocation levels:
- **Momentum**: 80% allocation (high conviction)
- **Stress**: 30% allocation (risk reduction)
- **Normal**: 60% allocation (moderate exposure)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `06_qvm_engine_v3e_fixed.py` - Main Python implementation with percentile-based regime detection
- `06_qvm_engine_v3e_fixed.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook version (converted via jupytext)
- `config/config_v3e_percentile_regime.yml` - Configuration file with percentile-based parameters
- `test_regime_detection.py` - Test script to verify regime detection works correctly

### Key Classes:
- `RegimeDetector` - Completely rewritten with percentile-based approach
- `QVMEngineV3AdoptedInsights` - Enhanced with robust regime detection
- `SectorAwareFactorCalculator` - Improved factor calculations

## Test Results

The test script confirms the fix is working:

```
Regime Distribution:
==============================
normal: 123 (89.8%)
stress: 8 (5.8%)
momentum: 6 (4.4%)

Unique regimes detected: 3
âœ… SUCCESS: Multiple regimes detected - percentile-based approach is working!
```

## Benefits

1. **Adaptive**: Regime detection adapts to changing market conditions
2. **Robust**: Handles different market environments properly
3. **Dynamic**: Portfolio allocations change based on regime shifts
4. **Reliable**: No more single-regime detection issues
5. **Configurable**: Easy to adjust percentile thresholds via configuration

## Usage

To use the fixed QVM Engine v3e:

1. Load the configuration:
```python
with open('config/config_v3e_percentile_regime.yml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)
```

2. Initialize the engine:
```python
engine = QVMEngineV3AdoptedInsights(
    config=config,
    price_data=price_data,
    fundamental_data=fundamental_data,
    returns_matrix=returns_matrix,
    benchmark_returns=benchmark_returns,
    db_engine=db_engine
)
```

3. Run the backtest:
```python
strategy_returns, diagnostics = engine.run_backtest()
```

The engine will now properly detect multiple regimes and adjust portfolio allocations accordingly, providing a much more robust and adaptive investment strategy.
