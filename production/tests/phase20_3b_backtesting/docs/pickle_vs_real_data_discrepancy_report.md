## 🔍 Implications for Backtesting

❓ **INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR COMPARISON**
- Limited overlap between pickle and database data
- May indicate different data sources or time periods
- Further investigation required

## 📋 Recommendations

1. **Data Source Alignment**
   - Ensure pickle data uses same source as database
   - Verify calculation methodologies are identical
   - Update pickle data if outdated
2. **Validation Framework**
   - Always validate simplified results with real data
   - Use consistent data sources across all analyses
   - Document data source differences
3. **Methodology Review**
   - Review simplified backtesting assumptions
   - Consider real market dynamics in simulations
   - Implement more realistic transaction cost models
