## Success Criteria Assessment

### ‚ùå Failed Criteria
1. **Regime Classification Accuracy <80%** (53.5% achieved)
2. **Performance Improvement <50bps** (-16bps achieved)
3. **Risk Reduction <20%** (+1.98% achieved)

### Overall Assessment: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Regime Identification Issues

### 2. Factor Weight Optimization Issues
- **Static Regime Weights**: Current weights may not be optimal
- **No Regime Confidence**: Equal weight regardless of regime certainty
- **Missing Transaction Costs**: No consideration of switching costs
- **No Smoothing**: Abrupt weight changes may cause instability

### 3. Implementation Challenges
- **Data Quality**: Synthetic data may not reflect real market conditions
- **Look-Ahead Bias**: Potential for future information leakage
- **Overfitting Risk**: Parameters may be optimized for specific periods
