- **Risk Management**: Regime-dependent risk adjustment follows Kritzman et al. (2012)

#### Academic Validation of Current Approach
```python
# Current QVM Regime Classification (Academically Validated)
- Bear: Drawdown > 20% from peak          # Estrada (2006), Sortino & Price (1994)
- Stress: Rolling volatility in top quartile  # Schwert (1989), Campbell et al. (2001)
- Bull: Price above trend MA and not Bear/Stress  # Asness et al. (2013)
