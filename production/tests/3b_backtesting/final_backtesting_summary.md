## üîç Critical Analysis

### Why the Discrepancy?

1. **Real vs Simulated Data:**
   - Real data includes actual market correlations, crashes, and recovery periods
   - Simulated data was based on idealized factor score relationships
   - Real data shows the true impact of market-wide drawdowns

2. **Liquidity Premium Reality:**
   - Lower liquidity stocks may have higher transaction costs in reality
   - Market impact and slippage are more severe for less liquid stocks
   - Factor decay may be faster in less liquid stocks

3. **Market Conditions:**
   - The 2018-2025 period includes significant market stress (COVID-19, etc.)
   - Less liquid stocks may underperform during market stress
   - Higher correlation during crisis periods

### Universe Analysis

**10B VND Threshold:**
- Universe size: ~164 stocks
- Average ADTV: 151.1B VND
- Higher quality, more liquid stocks
- Better factor persistence

**3B VND Threshold:**
- Universe size: ~230 stocks (+66 stocks, 1.4x expansion)
- Average ADTV: 109.5B VND
- Includes lower quality, less liquid stocks
- Potential factor decay issues

## üéØ Implementation Decision

### ‚ùå **IMPLEMENTATION REJECTED**

**Rationale:**
1. **Performance Degradation:** 3B VND threshold shows significant performance decline
2. **Risk Increase:** Higher drawdown and worse risk-adjusted returns
3. **Alpha Erosion:** Significant decline in alpha generation
4. **Real Data Validation:** The simplified backtesting was overly optimistic

**Decision Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Performance maintained or improved: **FAILED**
- ‚úÖ Risk metrics within acceptable range: **FAILED** 
- ‚úÖ Sharpe ratio maintained: **FAILED**

## üéØ Final Decision

**Based on comprehensive real data backtesting, the 3B VND liquidity threshold is REJECTED for implementation.**

**Key Reasons:**
1. **Significant performance degradation** (-10.77% annual return)
2. **Worse risk-adjusted returns** (Sharpe ratio decline from 0.45 to -0.03)
3. **Higher drawdown risk** (-31.57% vs -30.28%)
4. **Real data validation** shows the simplified backtesting was overly optimistic

**Next Steps:**
1. Maintain current 10B VND threshold
2. Investigate alternative thresholds (5B, 7B, 8B VND)
3. Conduct factor persistence analysis by liquidity level
4. Implement enhanced risk management for liquidity considerations
