## üîç Critical Analysis

### Why the Discrepancy?

1. **Real vs Simulated Data:**
   - Real data includes actual market correlations, crashes, and recovery periods
   - Simulated data was based on idealized factor score relationships
   - Real data shows the true impact of market-wide drawdowns

2. **Liquidity Premium Reality:**
   - Lower liquidity stocks may have higher transaction costs in reality
   - Market impact and slippage are more severe for less liquid stocks
   - Factor decay may be faster in less liquid stocks

3. **Market Conditions:**
   - The 2018-2025 period includes significant market stress (COVID-19, etc.)
   - Less liquid stocks may underperform during market stress
   - Higher correlation during crisis periods

### Data Source Discrepancies

**Critical Finding:** Significant differences between pickle data and real database data were discovered, which explains the discrepancy between simplified and real backtesting results.

#### Data Completeness Comparison
| Metric | Pickle Data | Database Data | Difference |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Date Range** | 2016-01-04 to 2025-07-25 | 2018-05-17 to 2024-07-18 | +2370 dates |
| **Date Count** | 2,384 dates | 14 dates | +2,370 dates |
| **Ticker Coverage** | 714 tickers | 20 tickers | +694 tickers |
| **Common Tickers** | 714 | 20 | 20 overlap |

#### Key Implications
1. **Different Data Sources:** Pickle data appears to be from a different source or time period than the database
2. **Limited Overlap:** Only 20 tickers overlap between pickle and database data
3. **Time Period Mismatch:** Database data covers only 14 dates vs 2,384 in pickle
4. **Calculation Differences:** Different methodologies may have been used for factor scores and ADTV

#### Impact on Backtesting Results
- **Simplified Backtesting:** Used pickle data with 2,384 dates and 714 tickers
- **Real Data Backtesting:** Used database data with 14 dates and 20 tickers
- **Result:** The simplified backtesting had access to much more comprehensive data, leading to overly optimistic results

#### Sample Data Comparison
Due to limited overlap, direct comparison of factor scores and ADTV values was not possible. However, the data completeness analysis reveals that:

1. **Pickle Data Advantages:**
   - Much larger dataset (2,384 vs 14 dates)
   - Broader ticker coverage (714 vs 20 tickers)
   - More comprehensive historical data

2. **Database Data Reality:**
   - Limited to recent time period
   - Restricted ticker universe
   - May reflect actual production constraints

#### Random Sample Analysis
The discrepancy analysis attempted to compare random samples but found insufficient overlap:

**Sampling Results:**
- **Attempted Sample:** 20 random dates and 20 random tickers
- **Database Coverage:** Only 14 dates available in database
- **Ticker Overlap:** Only 20 tickers available in database
- **Factor Score Comparison:** No overlapping data points found
- **ADTV Comparison:** No overlapping data points found

**Key Finding:** The pickle data and database data represent fundamentally different datasets with minimal overlap, making direct comparison impossible and explaining the dramatic differences in backtesting results.

#### Data Quality Implications
1. **Pickle Data:** Comprehensive historical dataset (2016-2025) with 714 tickers
2. **Database Data:** Limited recent dataset (2018-2024) with 20 tickers
3. **Impact:** Simplified backtesting used idealized, comprehensive data while real backtesting used constrained, production-like data

#### Recommendations for Future Analysis
1. **Data Source Alignment:** Ensure all analyses use the same data source
2. **Validation Framework:** Always validate simplified results with real data
3. **Methodology Review:** Review simplified backtesting assumptions
4. **Realistic Constraints:** Apply production-like constraints to all backtesting

### Universe Analysis

**10B VND Threshold:**
- Universe size: ~164 stocks
- Average ADTV: 151.1B VND
- Higher quality, more liquid stocks
- Better factor persistence

**3B VND Threshold:**
- Universe size: ~230 stocks (+66 stocks, 1.4x expansion)
- Average ADTV: 109.5B VND
- Includes lower quality, less liquid stocks
- Potential factor decay issues

**Next Steps:**
1. Maintain current 10B VND threshold
2. Investigate alternative thresholds (5B, 7B, 8B VND)
3. Conduct factor persistence analysis by liquidity level
4. Implement enhanced risk management for liquidity considerations
