## üîç Factor-Specific Analysis

### **Distribution by Factor Type**

#### **Quality Score**
- **Concentration:** Heavily concentrated in Below 1B VND bucket
- **Pattern:** Quality stocks tend to be smaller, less liquid companies
- **Implication:** Quality factor benefits from lower liquidity threshold

#### **Value Score**
- **Concentration:** Extremely concentrated in Below 1B VND bucket
- **Pattern:** Value stocks are predominantly small-cap, low-liquidity
- **Implication:** Value factor heavily impacted by current 10B VND filter

#### **Momentum Score**
- **Concentration:** More evenly distributed across buckets
- **Pattern:** Momentum stocks include both small and large companies
- **Implication:** Momentum factor less impacted by liquidity filter

#### **QVM Composite Score**
- **Concentration:** Moderate concentration in Below 1B VND bucket
- **Pattern:** Balanced distribution reflecting composite nature
- **Implication:** Composite factor benefits from broader universe

## üö® Critical Business Implications

### **1. Alpha Loss Due to Current Filter**
- **51.9% of high-scoring stocks excluded** by 10B VND threshold
- **Significant alpha opportunities missed** in lower liquidity buckets
- **Performance degradation** due to restrictive filtering

### **2. Concentration Risk**
- **Over-concentration** in high-liquidity stocks (above 10B VND)
- **Limited diversification** across market segments
- **Reduced exposure** to potentially high-performing smaller stocks

### **3. Market Inefficiency Exploitation**
- **Small-cap stocks** often less efficiently priced
- **Higher alpha potential** in lower liquidity segments
- **Competitive advantage** through broader universe access

## üìã Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **‚úÖ Implement 3B VND threshold** - Critical for alpha preservation
2. **Monitor performance impact** - Track improvements in strategy metrics
3. **Expand universe monitoring** - Track universe size and composition
4. **Risk assessment** - Ensure adequate liquidity for trading

### **Long-term Considerations**
1. **Dynamic liquidity thresholds** - Consider market-adaptive thresholds
2. **Sector-specific analysis** - Different sectors may need different thresholds
3. **Performance attribution** - Monitor contribution of newly included stocks
4. **Transaction cost analysis** - Assess impact of larger universe on costs
