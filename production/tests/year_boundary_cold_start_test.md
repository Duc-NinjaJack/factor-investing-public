# Year Boundary Cold Start Test

**Purpose**: Test the engine's ability to handle "cold start" at year boundaries

**The Real Scenario**: 
- We want to generate factors for 2018-01-01 (first day of year)
- The engine needs 2017 data for TTM and YoY calculations
- This tests if the engine can "look back" to previous year's data

**Test Method**:
1. Try January 1st dates from different years
2. See if the engine can find the correct quarter data
3. Validate that it produces sensible factor scores

First, let's test if the engine can correctly identify which quarter data should be available for each January 1st date.

        print(f"   ‚úÖ Found quarter: {year} Q{quarter}")
        
        # Calculate expected quarter (should be Q3 of previous year for Jan 1)
        # Jan 1 + 45 day lag = ~Feb 15, so Q4 of prev year should be available
        expected_year = test_date.year - 1
        expected_quarter = 4  # Q4 of previous year should be published by Jan + 45 days
        
        if year == expected_year and quarter >= 3:  # Q3 or Q4 of previous year is reasonable
            status = "‚úÖ LOGICAL"
        else:
            status = "‚ö†Ô∏è  UNEXPECTED"
            
        print(f"   {status} (Expected: ~{expected_year} Q3/Q4)")

## What This Test Validates

This test specifically validates the **cold start problem** at year boundaries:

1. **2020-01-01 test**: Can the engine fetch 2019 Q4 data for TTM calculations?
2. **2021-01-01 test**: Can the engine fetch 2020 Q4 data for TTM calculations?
3. **Quarter lookup logic**: Does `get_correct_quarter_for_date` correctly identify available quarters?
4. **Cross-year dependencies**: Can each year's generation access the previous year's data?

If these tests pass, it proves that:
- **Terminal 2 (2018-2019)** can safely run in parallel because it will correctly fetch 2017 data
- **Terminal 3 (2020-2022)** can safely run in parallel because it will correctly fetch 2019 data
- Each terminal is self-contained and doesn't depend on other terminals running first

This is the real test of the "cold start" robustness for parallel historical generation.
