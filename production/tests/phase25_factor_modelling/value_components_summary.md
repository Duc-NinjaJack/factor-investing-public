## üéØ **Strategy Implications**

### **Component-Specific Value Strategy:**

#### **1. P/B-Focused Approach (Primary Driver):**
```python
def pb_focused_value_strategy(data):
    """
    P/B-focused value strategy (primary contrarian signal)
    """
    # P/B score is the strongest contrarian signal
    pb_signal = -data['pb_score']  # Strong contrarian
    
    # Quality-adjusted P/B approach
    if data['roaa_quintile'] == 'Q2':
        pb_signal = data['pb_score'] * 0.1  # Weak positive
    elif data['roaa_quintile'] == 'Q3':
        pb_signal = -data['pb_score'] * 2.0  # Very strong contrarian
    
    return pb_signal
```

#### **2. P/E-Adjusted Approach (Secondary Driver):**
```python
def pe_adjusted_value_strategy(data):
    """
    P/E-adjusted value strategy (moderate contrarian signal)
    """
    # P/E score shows moderate contrarian behavior
    pe_signal = -data['pe_score']  # Moderate contrarian
    
    # Quality-adjusted P/E approach
    if data['roaa_quintile'] == 'Q2':
        pe_signal = data['pe_score']  # Positive signal
    elif data['roaa_quintile'] == 'Q1 (Lowest)':
        pe_signal = -data['pe_score'] * 1.5  # Strong contrarian
    
    return pe_signal
```

#### **3. P/S Opportunistic Approach (Weakest Signal):**
```python
def ps_opportunistic_strategy(data):
    """
    P/S opportunistic strategy (weakest but positive in some regimes)
    """
    # P/S score shows regime-dependent behavior
    if data['roaa_quintile'] == 'Q3':
        ps_signal = data['ps_score']  # Positive signal
    else:
        ps_signal = -data['ps_score'] * 0.5  # Weak contrarian
    
    return ps_signal
```

#### **4. Enhanced Composite Strategy:**
```python
def enhanced_composite_strategy(data):
    """
    Enhanced composite strategy leveraging component interactions
    """
    # Base weights (banking sector)
    pb_weight = 0.4
    pe_weight = 0.6
    
    # Quality-adjusted weights
    if data['roaa_quintile'] == 'Q2':
        pb_weight = 0.3
        pe_weight = 0.7
    elif data['roaa_quintile'] == 'Q3':
        pb_weight = 0.6  # Increase P/B weight for stronger contrarian
        pe_weight = 0.4
    
    # Component signals
    pb_signal = -data['pb_score']  # Contrarian
    pe_signal = -data['pe_score']  # Contrarian
    
    # Enhanced composite (accounting for interactions)
    enhanced_score = (
        pb_signal * pb_weight +
        pe_signal * pe_weight
    ) * 1.2  # Amplify for interaction effects
    
    return enhanced_score
```

## üîç **Economic Interpretation**

### **Why P/B Score Shows Strongest Contrarian Signal:**
1. **Book Value Stability:** Book values are more stable than earnings
2. **Value Trap Detection:** High P/B ratios often indicate overvaluation
3. **Asset Quality:** P/B reflects asset quality and efficiency
4. **Market Sentiment:** P/B captures market sentiment about asset values

### **Why P/E Score Shows Moderate Contrarian Signal:**
1. **Earnings Volatility:** Earnings are more volatile than book values
2. **Growth Expectations:** P/E reflects growth expectations
3. **Quality Premium:** High P/E may reflect quality premium
4. **Earnings Quality:** P/E depends on earnings quality

### **Why P/S Score Shows Weakest Signal:**
1. **Revenue Stability:** Sales are more stable than earnings
2. **Margin Effects:** P/S doesn't account for profit margins
3. **Industry Differences:** P/S varies significantly by industry
4. **Growth Bias:** P/S may favor growth over value

### **Why Interaction Effects Amplify the Signal:**
1. **Synergistic Effects:** P/E and P/B reinforce each other
2. **Quality Confirmation:** Both ratios confirm quality assessment
3. **Market Inefficiency:** Market misprices multiple ratios simultaneously
4. **Risk Amplification:** Multiple contrarian signals amplify risk

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Considerations**

### **Component-Specific Risks:**
1. **P/B Risk:** Book value write-downs, asset quality deterioration
2. **P/E Risk:** Earnings manipulation, cyclical earnings
3. **P/S Risk:** Revenue recognition issues, margin compression
4. **Interaction Risk:** Correlation breakdown between components

### **Quality Quintile Risks:**
1. **Q2 Risk:** Moderate quality may deteriorate
2. **Q3 Risk:** Value trap in moderate-low quality
3. **Q1 Risk:** Low quality may become uninvestable
4. **Q5 Risk:** Quality premium may expand further

### **Implementation Risks:**
1. **Data Quality:** Component calculation accuracy
2. **Weight Stability:** Optimal weights may change over time
3. **Regime Changes:** Component relationships may shift
4. **Liquidity Constraints:** Component-specific liquidity issues
