    "**The Real Scenario**: \n",
    "- We want to generate factors for 2018-01-01 (first day of year)\n",
    "- The engine needs 2017 data for TTM and YoY calculations\n",
    "- This tests if the engine can \"look back\" to previous year's data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Method**:\n",
    "1. Try January 1st dates from different years\n",
    "2. See if the engine can find the correct quarter data\n",
    "3. Validate that it produces sensible factor scores"
