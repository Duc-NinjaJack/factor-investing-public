    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: When we run historical generation for 2018 data, can the engine correctly fetch 2017 data it needs for TTM and YoY calculations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Method**: \n",
    "1. Use a date we know has data (2024-07-01)\n",
    "2. Run the calculation multiple times with fresh engine instances\n",
    "3. Verify identical results = proves the engine is deterministic and self-contained"

    "1. **Self-Contained Logic**: The engine doesn't depend on any external state or previous calculations\n",
    "2. **Robust Data Fetching**: Each engine instance correctly fetches all historical data it needs\n",
