# Component Contribution Analysis - QVM Engine v3j

## Overview

This analysis breaks down the QVM Engine v3j into its core components to understand the contribution of each component to overall performance and Sharpe ratio.

## Components Analyzed

### 1. Base Strategy (01_base_strategy.py)
- **Description**: Equal weight allocation with no factors or regime detection
- **Purpose**: Serves as the baseline for comparison
- **Features**:
  - Top 200 stocks by ADTV
  - Equal weight allocation (20 stocks)
  - Monthly rebalancing
  - No factor analysis
  - No regime detection
  - Always 100% invested

### 2. Regime-Only Strategy (02_regime_only.py)
- **Description**: Regime detection only, no factor analysis
- **Purpose**: Isolate the contribution of regime detection
- **Features**:
  - Same universe as base strategy
  - Regime-based allocation (Bull: 100%, Bear: 80%, Sideways: 60%, Stress: 40%)
  - Equal weight within each regime
  - No factor analysis

### 3. Factors-Only Strategy (03_factors_only.py)
- **Description**: Factor analysis only, no regime detection
- **Purpose**: Isolate the contribution of factor analysis
- **Features**:
  - Same universe as base strategy
  - Factor-based stock selection (ROAA + P/E + Momentum)
  - Always 100% invested
  - No regime detection

### 4. Integrated Strategy (04_integrated_strategy.py)
- **Description**: Full strategy with both regime detection and factor analysis
- **Purpose**: Show the combined effect of all components
- **Features**:
  - Regime-based allocation
  - Factor-based stock selection
  - Combined approach

## Expected Insights

### Performance Hierarchy
Based on theoretical expectations, we anticipate the following performance hierarchy:

1. **Integrated Strategy** (Highest Sharpe)
   - Combines regime detection and factor analysis
   - Should provide the best risk-adjusted returns

2. **Factors-Only Strategy** (Medium-High Sharpe)
   - Factor analysis should add value over equal weight
   - May have higher volatility than regime-only

3. **Regime-Only Strategy** (Medium Sharpe)
   - Regime detection should reduce drawdowns
   - May have lower returns but better risk management

4. **Base Strategy** (Lowest Sharpe)
   - Equal weight baseline
   - No alpha generation mechanisms

### Component Contributions

#### Regime Detection Contribution
- **Expected Benefit**: Risk management and drawdown reduction
- **Measurement**: Compare Regime-Only vs Base strategy
- **Key Metrics**: Max Drawdown, Calmar Ratio, Sharpe Ratio

#### Factor Analysis Contribution
- **Expected Benefit**: Alpha generation and return enhancement
- **Measurement**: Compare Factors-Only vs Base strategy
- **Key Metrics**: Annualized Return, Information Ratio, Sharpe Ratio

#### Integration Effect
- **Expected Benefit**: Synergistic combination of risk management and alpha generation
- **Measurement**: Compare Integrated vs individual components
- **Key Metrics**: Overall Sharpe Ratio improvement

## Analysis Methodology

### Data Consistency
- All strategies use the same universe (Top 200 stocks by ADTV)
- Same rebalancing frequency (monthly)
- Same transaction costs (30 bps)
- Same time period (2016-2025)

### Performance Metrics
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Primary measure of risk-adjusted returns
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Risk management effectiveness
- **Information Ratio**: Alpha generation relative to benchmark
- **Calmar Ratio**: Return per unit of maximum drawdown
- **Annualized Return**: Absolute performance
- **Annualized Volatility**: Risk measure

### Statistical Significance
- Long backtest period (9+ years) provides statistical power
- Multiple market regimes included in analysis
- Out-of-sample validation through time series

## Expected Findings

### 1. Regime Detection Value
- Should reduce maximum drawdown by 20-40%
- May reduce annualized returns by 5-15%
- Net effect on Sharpe ratio depends on risk-return trade-off

### 2. Factor Analysis Value
- Should increase annualized returns by 10-30%
- May increase volatility slightly
- Should improve information ratio significantly

### 3. Integration Synergy
- Combined approach should outperform individual components
- Synergy effect of 5-15% additional Sharpe ratio improvement
- Better risk-adjusted returns across all market regimes

### Execution Order
1. Run individual strategy files to generate baseline results
2. Run component comparison analysis for comprehensive comparison
3. Analyze results and document insights

### Key Success Metrics
- **Sharpe Ratio Improvement**: Each component should add 0.1-0.3 to Sharpe ratio
- **Drawdown Reduction**: Regime detection should reduce max drawdown by 20%+
- **Alpha Generation**: Factor analysis should generate 5-15% annual alpha
- **Integration Synergy**: Combined approach should outperform sum of parts

## Conclusion

This component analysis will provide quantitative evidence of the value added by each component of the QVM Engine v3j, helping to validate the strategy design and identify areas for potential improvement.
