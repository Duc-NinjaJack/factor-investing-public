### Key Performance Insights

#### üèÜ **Winner: Adaptive Rebalancing Strategy**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.224 (highest)
- **Annualized Return:** 29.07% (highest)
- **Max Drawdown:** -24.34% (lowest among top performers)
- **Calmar Ratio:** 1.195 (highest)

**Why it works:**
- Regime-specific rebalancing frequency optimizes transaction costs
- Weekly rebalancing in bull markets captures momentum
- Quarterly rebalancing in stress markets reduces unnecessary trading
- Dynamic allocation based on market conditions

#### ü•à **Runner-up: Enhanced Factor Integration**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.032 (second highest)
- **Annualized Return:** 24.27% (second highest)
- **Factor Coverage:** 6 factors (most comprehensive)

**Why it works:**
- Additional factors (Low-Volatility, Piotroski F-Score, FCF Yield) improve diversification
- Normalized factor weights ensure balanced exposure
- Enhanced quality assessment through Piotroski F-Score
- Better defensive characteristics through Low-Volatility factor

#### ü•â **Third Place: Risk Parity Enhancement**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.444
- **Risk Management:** Equal risk contribution per factor
- **Stability:** Most balanced risk allocation

**Why it works:**
- Equal risk contribution reduces factor concentration
- Dynamic weight optimization based on factor volatilities
- Weight constraints prevent extreme allocations
- Volatility-based risk measure provides stability

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Fourth Place: Dynamic Factor Weights**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.408
- **Regime Adaptation:** Different weights per market condition
- **Factor Flexibility:** Dynamic exposure adjustment

**Why it works:**
- Regime-specific factor weights adapt to market conditions
- Higher momentum weights in bull markets
- Higher defensive weights in bear/stress markets
- Reduced factor correlation through dynamic weighting
