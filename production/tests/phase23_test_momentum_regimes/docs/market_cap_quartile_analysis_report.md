- **2021-2025**: Poor momentum performance across all sizes
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Reduce momentum exposure in current regime

### 3. **Risk Management**
- **Size Diversification**: Balance between Q1 and Q2 for optimal risk/return
- **Regime Monitoring**: Track momentum performance for regime shifts
- **Quality Gates**: Use IC thresholds for factor allocation decisions

### 4. **Portfolio Construction**
- **Small Cap Momentum**: 60-70% allocation to Q1/Q2 momentum
- **Mid Cap Balance**: 20-30% allocation to Q3 for diversification
- **Large Cap Minimal**: 0-10% allocation to Q4 momentum

## Technical Notes

### Data Quality Issues
1. **Sector Representation**: Many sectors have only 1-3 stocks per quartile
2. **Cross-sectional Fallback**: Used when sector-neutral normalization fails
3. **Fundamental Data**: Some stocks missing fundamental metrics

### Analysis Limitations
1. **Sample Size**: 50 stocks per quartile may be insufficient for some sectors
2. **Time Period**: 2021-2025 analysis incomplete due to interruption
3. **Market Cap Stability**: Quartile composition changes over time

### Quality Checks
1. **Minimum Stocks**: 10 stocks minimum per quartile for IC calculation
2. **Data Completeness**: Fundamental data required for momentum calculation
3. **Price Data**: Forward returns calculated from actual price data

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement Size-Based Momentum**: Focus on Q1 and Q2 momentum factors
2. **Reduce Large Cap Exposure**: Minimize Q4 momentum allocation
3. **Monitor Regime Shifts**: Track momentum performance for regime changes

### Medium-term Actions
1. **Develop Size-Specific Models**: Create separate momentum models for each quartile
2. **Optimize Universe Size**: Consider larger universe for better sector representation
3. **Enhance Data Quality**: Improve fundamental data completeness

### Long-term Actions
1. **Regime Detection**: Develop automated regime detection system
2. **Dynamic Weighting**: Implement regime-aware factor weighting
3. **Multi-Factor Integration**: Combine momentum with other factors by size

## Conclusion

The market cap quartile analysis provides strong evidence for a size effect in momentum factor performance. Small-cap companies (Q1 and Q2) consistently outperform large-cap companies (Q3 and Q4) in the 2016-2020 period. However, the 2021-2025 period shows poor momentum performance across all quartiles, suggesting a regime shift.

**Key Takeaway**: Momentum factor effectiveness is strongly influenced by company size, with smaller companies showing better momentum characteristics. Current market conditions appear unfavorable for momentum strategies across all market cap segments.
