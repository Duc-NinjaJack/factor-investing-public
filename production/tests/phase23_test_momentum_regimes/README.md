# Phase 23: Momentum Regime Validation

This module tests the Information Coefficient (IC) and regime effectiveness of the momentum factor across different market regimes (pre- and post-COVID).

## Structure

- `01_momentum_regime_validation_tests.py`: Main script for running regime-based IC tests on the momentum factor.
- `docs/`: Documentation and methodology for regime-based momentum testing.
- `data/`: Data outputs, intermediate results, or test datasets.
- `img/`: Plots and visualizations generated by the tests.

## Regimes Tested

- **2016-2020**: Pre-COVID regime
- **2021-2025**: Post-COVID regime

## What is Tested?

- **Momentum IC**: Spearman rank correlation between momentum factor scores and forward returns
- **Multiple Horizons**: 1M, 3M, 6M, 12M forward returns
- **Regime Comparison**: Statistical comparison of IC and hit rates between regimes

## Usage

```bash
cd production/tests/phase23_test_momentum_regimes
python 01_momentum_regime_validation_tests.py
```

## Output

- Console summary of IC statistics for each regime and horizon
- Quality assessment (mean IC, t-stat, hit rate)
- (Optional) Save results to `data/` or plots to `img/`

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, pymysql, etc.
- Access to the factor investing database
