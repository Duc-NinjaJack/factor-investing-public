    "# Aureus Sigma Capital - Phase 27e: Walk-Forward Adaptive Engine\n",
    "# Notebook: 28_walk_forward_adaptive_engine.ipynb\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Objective:\n",
    "#   To build and validate the definitive, institutional-grade production model.\n",
    "#   This notebook addresses the core failure of the static regime model by\n",
    "#   implementing a Walk-Forward Optimizer. This system will dynamically learn\n",
    "#   and adapt factor weights based on recent market history, creating a proactive\n",
    "#   strategy. This is the final sprint to meet all Investment Committee hurdles.\n",

    "# --- STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE & DIAGNOSIS ---\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The Phase 27c Regime-Adaptive model failed (Sharpe 0.72, Return 8.89%) due to\n",
    "# a lagging regime indicator and a flawed risk overlay that resulted in permanent\n",
    "# de-risking. The root cause is that our static, rule-based approach cannot adapt\n",
    "# to the changing efficacy of factors in the Vietnamese market.\n",

    "# --- METHODOLOGY: THE WALK-FORWARD OPTIMIZER ---\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This notebook will build the `PortfolioEngine_v3.0` with a new core architecture:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1.  **Walk-Forward Framework**: The backtest will be structured as a series of\n",
    "#     expanding windows.\n",
    "#     -   **Training Period**: A 24-month lookback window.\n",
    "#     -   **Trading Period**: A 6-month \"out-of-sample\" trading period.\n",
    "# 2.  **Dynamic Weight Optimization**: At the start of each 6-month trading period,\n",
    "#     the engine will run an optimization process on the preceding 24 months of\n",
    "#     data to find the factor weights (for V, Q, M, R) that maximize the Sharpe Ratio.\n",
    "# 3.  **Bayesian Priors**: The optimizer will be constrained with sensible priors\n",
    "#     (e.g., Value weight must be ≥ 30%) to ensure stability and prevent extreme,\n",
    "#     uninvestable allocations.\n",
    "# 4.  **Full Risk Management**: The final, fully-managed version will apply our\n",
    "#     validated Hybrid Volatility Overlay and Portfolio Stop-Loss to the P&L\n",
    "#     generated by the superior, dynamically-weighted alpha signal.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# --- SUCCESS CRITERIA ---\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The final, fully-managed, walk-forward optimized strategy must meet all\n",
    "# Investment Committee hurdles over the full 2016-2025 backtest period:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   -   **Sharpe Ratio**: ≥ 1.0\n",
