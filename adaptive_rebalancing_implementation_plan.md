# Adaptive Rebalancing Implementation Plan

## Key Learnings from 12_adaptive_rebalancing_final.py

### 1. **Adaptive Rebalancing System** (Primary Innovation)
- **Current**: Fixed monthly rebalancing
- **Improvement**: Regime-based rebalancing frequency
  - Bull Market: Weekly rebalancing (100% allocation)
  - Bear Market: Monthly rebalancing (80% allocation)
  - Sideways Market: Biweekly rebalancing (60% allocation)
  - Volatile Market: Quarterly rebalancing (40% allocation)

### 2. **Regime Detection System**
- **Current**: No market regime awareness
- **Improvement**: Systematic regime detection based on:
  - Volatility thresholds (1.40% - 75th percentile)
  - Return thresholds (0.12% - 75th percentile)
  - 30-day lookback period for faster execution

### 3. **Enhanced Configuration Structure**
- **Current**: Basic configuration
- **Improvement**: Comprehensive regime-aware configuration with:
  - Explicit factor weights for each category
  - Regime-specific parameters
  - Detailed rebalancing rules

### 4. **Better Diagnostics and Performance Attribution**
- **Current**: Basic performance metrics
- **Improvement**: Regime distribution analysis, portfolio evolution tracking

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Add Regime Detection
1. Create `RegimeDetector` class
2. Integrate into `QVMEngineV3jValidatedFactors`
3. Add regime detection to backtesting loop

### Phase 2: Implement Adaptive Rebalancing
1. Modify rebalancing date generation
2. Add regime-specific allocation adjustments
3. Update portfolio construction logic

### Phase 3: Enhance Configuration
1. Add regime detection parameters
2. Add adaptive rebalancing rules
3. Maintain existing factor calculation structure

### Phase 4: Improve Diagnostics
1. Add regime tracking to diagnostics
2. Include regime distribution in tearsheet
3. Track regime-specific performance

## Expected Benefits
- **Reduced Transaction Costs**: Less frequent rebalancing in unfavorable markets
- **Better Performance Capture**: More frequent rebalancing in favorable markets
- **Risk Management**: Regime-specific allocation adjustments
- **Performance Attribution**: Better understanding of strategy behavior

## Compatibility Considerations
- Maintain existing factor calculation methods
- Preserve current tearsheet generation
- Keep data loading structure intact
- Ensure backward compatibility
